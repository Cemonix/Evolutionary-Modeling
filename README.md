## Overview

Evolutionary algorithms are a family of optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection. They are widely used in solving complex optimization problems where traditional methods might struggle.

This project aims to provide a collection of evolutionary algorithms implemented in C using Raylib 5.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (ACO)
2. Differential Evolution (DE)
3. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

## Features

- Modular and extensible architecture
- Configurable parameters for algorithms
- Visualization of optimization process
- Documentation
